	abstract = {Across essentially all fields of research, many aspects of the respective research processes – whether experimental, theoretical, empirical or outright computational – are closely related to software. Yet the process of finding software that is directly suitable or at least a good starting point for a given research task is cumbersome.This project aims to develop a community-driven system that provides potential users of research software with a diversity of pathways towards actually finding software that closely matches their research needs if such software exists. Conversely, it will provide software developers with mechanisms to make their software findable for research-related tasks and it will highlight mismatches between software supply and demand for specific tasks.To this end, we will document how various stakeholders of the research landscape have been searching for – or stumbling upon – research software so far, identify variables associated with successful search outcomes and build workflows that assist in describing software and associated concepts in a standardised fashion. These descriptions will then be aligned across various sources of relevant information and integrated into Wikidata, the knowledge graph that anyone can edit and that already contains considerable breadth and depth of information related to research, software and their interactions.While keeping an eye on similar approaches to software discovery that might work in parts of the research ecosystem, existing Wikidata content and workflows will be reviewed and built upon. Additional documentation, tooling and workflows will be developed to enrich, expand, curate, query and explore this content, both for specific use cases and with ongoing engagement of the communities involved in research software, open data or collaborative curation. Within its three years, the project seeks to establish a dedicated community overseeing a well-documented and smoothly running infrastructure for software discovery and to devise a plan for how this can be sustained for the longer term.},

  abstract = {Software discovery is a crucial aspect of research, yet it remains a challenging process due to various reasons: The lack of a centralized or domain-tailored search and publication infrastructure, insufficient software citations, the prevailing unavailability of software (versions) and many others. Researchers tend to utilize general search engines and their social network before considering code repositories, (text + data) repositories, and package management platforms, among other locations, to find the software they need. The resulting fragmented ecosystem is characterized by parallel developments from different, yet partially overlapping, redundant and non-interoperable infrastructure providers and research communities. Moreover, the discovery process is further complicated by missing or imperfect metadata, which can lead to limited search results. To address these challenges, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the different software publication and discovery systems. We describe available discovery options, including code and publication repositories, domain, geographic, or institution-specific catalogs, classical search engines, curated lists, knowledge graphs, social networks, and all of these in various combinations, with and without the use of artificial intelligence. Besides characterizing each option, we will present examples, challenges and recommendations for an improved software discovery process. In addition, we will discuss the role of different stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, funders, publishers) and what they could do for better findability.},
