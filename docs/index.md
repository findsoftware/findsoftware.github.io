# find.software

With **find.software (Foundations for Interdisciplinary Discovery of (Research) Software)**, we aim to develop a single point of entry for searching for research software. Imagine you are looking for scientific software, regardless of your scientific field, the programming language or operating system you use, your technical knowledge, or whether you are a developer or a simple user. To this end, we are working together with **Wikidata** and the **scientific community** to build a solution for the community and with the community, an **open solution** that knows no national boundaries.

??? info "Abstract grant proposal:"

    Across essentially all fields of research, many aspects of the respective
    research processes - whether experimental, theoretical, empirical, or outright
    computational - are closely related to software. Yet the process of finding
    software that is directly suitable or at least a good starting point for a given
    research task is cumbersome. 
    
    This project aims to develop a community-driven
    system that provides potential users of research software with a diversity of
    pathways towards actually finding software that closely matches their research
    needs if such software exists. Conversely, it will provide software developers
    with mechanisms to make their software findable for research-related tasks, 
    andit will highlight mismatches between software supply and demand for specific
    tasks. 
    
    To this end, we will document how various stakeholders of the research
    landscape have been searching for - or stumbling upon - research software so
    far, identify variables associated with successful search outcomes, and build
    workflows that assist in describing software and associated concepts in a
    standardized fashion. These descriptions will then be aligned across various
    sources of relevant information and integrated into Wikidata, the knowledge
    graph that anyone can edit and that already contains considerable breadth and
    depth of information related to research, software, and their interactions.
    
    While keeping an eye on similar approaches to software discovery that might work
    in parts of the research ecosystem, existing Wikidata content and workflows will
    be reviewed and built upon. Additional documentation, tooling and workflows will
    be developed to enrich, expand, curate, query, and explore this content, both
    for specific use cases and with ongoing engagement of the communities involved
    in research software, open data, or collaborative curation. Within its three
    years, the project seeks to establish a dedicated community overseeing a
    well-documented and smoothly running infrastructure for software discovery and
    to devise a plan for how this can be sustained for the longer term.
