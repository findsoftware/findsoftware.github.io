# First blog post - DFG grant received

This is a our first blog post. And it already starts with good news. Our DFG
proposal [find.software: Foundations for Interdisciplinary Discovery of
(Research)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/567156310?language=en) was
approved by the DFG somewhen in August 2025. In the moment, our team consists of
[Daniel Mietchen](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9488-1870), [Jan
Bumberger](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3780-8663), [Moritz
Schubotz](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7141-4997), [Oliver
Karras](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5336-6899) and [Ronny
Gey](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1028-1670). One of the first tasks was to set
up a project website. And here we go. We use the [material
theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme with
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted with [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).
We also try to tooth here and then on Mastodon:
